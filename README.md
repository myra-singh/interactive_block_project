# interactive_block_project
This repository details the interactive block project for Parallel Works which contains a few examples of nodeworks files which demo some uses of the platform.

The demo.nc files contain some examples of how to run and connect nodes to create pathways. They are simple and can be reproduced relatively easily. The mynodes.py file contains two custom nodes which run the bash scripts in the folder. When reproducing those examples, the code in mynodes.py will have to be changed to reflect the pathway to the bash scripts on the user's computer. The nodeworks.yaml file contains the environment details of nodeworks. The platform can also be accessed by registering an account on the nodeworks website to recieve a unique download link. Here is the link to the nodeworks documentation, which may help with further bugs: https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/doc/nodeworks/20.2.0//userguide/developers/nodedoc.html

To run the nodeworks platform with the custom nodes, first download the nodeworks library either from the .yaml file or directly from the developer. Then, download the mynodes.py file and place it within the default nodes folder within the nodeworks code. Then launch the platform by running 'nodeworks' in the terminal. This will grant you access to the interactive workspace. You can then right click to add a node, and press the play button on the top left to run the code. For the custom nodes, the output will be displayed in the terminal.
